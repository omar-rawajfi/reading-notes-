## CSS


CSS (**cascading style sheet**) is language used for controling how the final look of the webpage will be (how the elements of the page are styled and laid out).without CSS elements will be viewed using the browser default settings which although readable are quite lacking in options.

The usage of CSS can range from specifying the size and color of text of any element to(headings,links,and paragraphs). To manipulating the size,position and borders of the elements.

CSS is a rule based language(a rule is like a statment like i want the text in this paragraph to be yellow and the background to be white). A rule begins with a **selector**(the element you want the rule to apply to. like h1). then **curly braces** which mark the beginning and the end of the area where you can make declarations. and finaly **declarations** , which are made of a **property** and a **value**, like **color** and **red** respectively.

New features are constantly being add to CSS by the CSS Working Group. Though not all browsers can support every feature of CSS .so before using some features check **Browser Compatibility**.

You can add CSS to a HTML file by using one of these methods:

1. Inline style (inside an HTML element like <p style="">)
2. Extenal CSS (link to a separate file) 
3. Internal ( in the head element)
