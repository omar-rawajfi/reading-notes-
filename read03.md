## Git 
Git : is a distributed version control system (Dvcs) that stores data in a file made of snapshots(a snopshot after every change).Git mostly relies on loval operations, so it can be used offline or on a VPN. Gir tracks every single change made on the system.

there are three stages for files

1. Committed.
2. Modified(not committed yet).
3. Staged(waiting to be committed).

Important commands:
1. Cloning a repo '(git clone [repos link])'
2. to clone and rename (git clone [repos link] (new name))
3. Status (git status)
4. Committing (git commit -m “made change x,y,z”)
5. to committe all (git commit -a)
6. Pushing(git push origin (branch name))
