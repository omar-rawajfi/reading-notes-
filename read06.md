## Javascript (JS)

Javascript is a dynamic programming language ,which is used to add interactivite to webpages. a standered web page is made using these languages (HTML,CSS,JS). HTML is used for structuring websites, CSS is used for styling, and finally JV is used to give the website it's dynamic trait.

whent we call a website dynamic it means it has the ability to update the display of the webpage to show different things in different circumstances. an example on a website being dynamic  is to display a differnt username when there is a change in the user. Or 

Javascript is an interpreted programming language, as in the code is run from top to bottom. unlike c++ which's a compiled programming language, the code is first transformed into another form before veing run.

### Adding JS to Your Web Page:
JV is added by using the (script) element similar to CSS (link) and (style) elements. JS is just like CSS it can be added as :

 1. inline (as in the element itself).
 2. internally (in the HTML file).
 3. externally (the JV is in a separate file and linked to the HTML file).

 ### HTML Code must Load First :
 in essence the HTML code must run before JS code, to avoid errors. Because HTML is the base structure, and JS needs the HTML elements for operations, HTML needs to load first. there are way to do this such as :

 1. using the **(defer)** or **(asynx)** attribute inside the script **(element)**
 2. putting the (script) element just before the closing of the body element.
